## ReliQ `setup`

Main driver is `setup/bootstrap.py`. It installs `Nim`, `UPC++`, and `Kokkos`. User is not expected to run `setup/bootstrap.py` from this directory; rather, they should execute `bootstrap`. Once full installation features for `setup/bootstrap.py` are finalized, this directory should contain information about its command line options.
