# ReliQ

This is an experimental lattice field theory framework written in the beautiful [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) programming language. We are currently exploring the use of a [partitioned global address space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitioned_global_address_space) for distributed/shared memory management and inter-process communication using the [UPC++](https://upcxx.lbl.gov/docs/html/guide.html) library. We are working toward building out a lattice field theory framework that is both enjoyable to use (i.e., user-friendly) and performant on current- and next-generation hybrid computing architectures.
